If we have agreed with you that your overdraft interest rate tracks Bank of England Base Rate, you should interpret any reference to "Barclays Base Rate" in this statement as if it read "Bank of England Base Rate".
## Dispute resolution

If you have a problem with your agreement, please try to resolve it with us in the first instance. If you are not happy with the way in which we handled your complaint or the result, you may be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. If you do not take up your problem with us first you will not be entitled to complain to the Ombudsman. We can provide details of how to contact the Ombudsman.

## Important information about compensation arrangements

We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The FSCS can pay compensation to depositors if a bank is unable to meet its financial obligations. Most depositors - including most individuals and businesses - are covered by the scheme.
We will issue the FSCS information sheet and exclusions list which set out in detail what is, and is not, covered by the FSCS, once a calendar year usually with your account statement.
For further information about the compensation provided by the FSCS, refer to the FSCS website at www.FSCS.org.uk.

## Important information about going

overdrawn without an agreed overdraft limit or exceeding your agreed overdraft limit An unarranged overdraft rate of $29.5 \%$ will apply if there is not enough money in your account(s) to make a payment and so cause an unarranged overdraft on your account(s).

## What is an unarranged overdraft?

An unarranged overdraft occurs where either:
a) you go overdrawn on your account without agreeing an overdraft with us first; or
b) you exceed your agreed overdraft limit.
c) not every Barclays product will allow you to go overdrawn or exceed your agreed overdraft limit. Please check your terms and conditions for more information.
If you try to make any payment from your account and you don't have the funds available, or if we have reasonable grounds to believe that you won't have sufficient funds on the date that the payment will be made from your account, we will treat this as a request to make, or extend, the use of our unarranged overdraft facilities. It's within our discretion to process the payment or return it unpaid.

## What can you do to help avoid or limit an unarranged

overdraft?
Get In Touch. If you become aware in advance that payments may take your account into an unarranged overdraft, please contact us as early as possible so that we can discuss the ways we could help. This will maximise the chances of us being able to:
a) understand any changes in your business and explore the options available;
b) consider options for authorised borrowing facilities;
c) facilitate payments being made;
d) limit the costs associated with unarranged borrowing;
e) address any concerns that you may have.

Register for Text Alerts. Business banking customers can register for our 'Near Limit' Text Alert which is designed to help you avoid going overdrawn (if you don't have an agreed overdraft limit), or exceeding your agreed overdraft limit, by notifying you when your balance falls below a figure you specify. Once you have signed up for this Text Alert, if your account goes into an unarranged overdraft, we'll send you a Text Alert the following working day (Monday - Friday) to let you know. By acting on this information you have the opportunity to clear your unarranged overdraft.

You can register for Text Alerts through Online Banking, in any of our branches or over the phone. Visit
barclays.co.uk/business-banking/ways-to-bank/mobile-banking for more information. Terms and conditions apply.
Go online for more support. For useful tips to keep on top of your cashflow, helpful downloadable tools, and a simple guide to borrowing, visit Barclays.co.uk/business-banking/borrow For details relating to unarranged borrowing, please refer to your banking services tariff guide.

Any reference to Bank of England Base Rate or Barclays Base Rate is the same rate. In the event that either of these rates is less than zero, the rate will be shown as zero on your statement. This does not affect our rights and obligations under our terms and conditions. If you require further information on the calculation of your interest rate, please contact us.

## Interest

Interest is calculated daily on the cleared balance of your account at the close of business. We'll let you know if interest is calculated on the statement balance rather than the cleared balance. The cleared balance includes only credits and debts that have cleared. Ask your branch or Barclays Business Team for details of clearance times and the dates when we pay or charge interest. The rates of interest shown are current at the time of printing this statement and may have changed during the period of the statement.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, from 6 April 2016 interest is paid gross. For UK resident individuals (including sole traders or partnerships), if you are a UK taxpayer you may have to pay tax on interest earned in excess of your Personal Savings Allowance. For information and guidance please refer to HMRC's website.
The management of your tax affairs is your responsibility, including making any required declarations to the relevant tax authority(ies), where you are tax resident. If the statement shows that we have applied interest to your account, we'll give you on request details of the rate(s) of interest used and a clear explanation of how the interest was calculated. Details of Barclays interest rates for business customers are available at
barclays.co.uk/business-banking.
Any reference to Bank of England Base Rate or Barclays Base Rate is the same rate. In the event that either of these rates is less than zero, the rate will be shown as zero on your statement. This does not affect our rights and obligations under our terms and conditions. If you require further information on the calculation of your interest rate, please contact us.

Using your debit card in the UK and abroad We will charge you a 2.75\% Non-Sterling Transaction Fee when making purchases, making a cash withdrawal, or when being refunded. This fee also applies whenever you do not pay in sterling, for example shopping online at a non-UK website.
As we explain in our customer terms, we calculate our exchange rate using the reference exchange rate for the Visa card scheme. In most circumstances, Visa converts transactions into sterling using the Visa Exchange Rate on the day the transaction is authorised. However for a small number of transactions the conversion may happen on the day the transaction is processed. As this may be a day or two later, the exchange rate may be different on that day. You'll find a comparison of our exchange rate for certain currencies as a mark-up against the rate published by the European Central Bank in the Barclays App or at the following website:
https://www.barclays.co.uk/fravel/using-debit-cardabroad/ This is updated twice a day. This may help you to decide whether you want to accept the conversion rate offered by the retailer or ATM provider or accept our rate.
International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and Bank Identification Code (SWIFTBIC) Your IBAN and SWIFTBIC are shown on the front of your statement. By using them you could reduce charges when receiving international payments in euros. Find out more at: business.barclays.co.uk/bb/ibanInformation.
